# From-Blue-to-Red

Dear newbie,
Hello and welcome to our company. As you have been acknowledged, this company delivers 
special packages from the red planet to special clients. But before you can become one of our members, you shall prove to be worthy of this role we are willing to give you. Our scientists have designed a perfectly standard test, which while measuring your skills in the most precise way, shall not harm you in any way. So without further ado, Letâ€™s proceed to the instructions.

You may use Up and Down arrows to move between lanes
You may use the red button you have been given (The Z key) to call a bullet from our spaceship which will always be in front of you. 
Whenever you felt the bullet is getting too close to your face, you may use the green button on the other side of the box you have been given (The X key) for our spaceship to recall the bullet.
Recalling must be done in a special place between player and the bullet to be effective. 
(It would have been a pleasure for me to describe to you how this mechanism works and how a bullet can be recallable but since you are -in the most respective way- an idiot, 
it would be pointless)

You may not want to get hit by a bullet or an enemy and you may not want the enemies to leave your line of sight.
Destroying drones and successfully recalling a bullet will be rewarded.

I wish you the best in your test.
Sincerely, The Boss

Beep and radio noises ...
You: Sorry boss why red planet again?
Boss: Oh god classic rookies because it's the theme you dummy now get your ass out of the spaceship and start training.
You: Roger that sir.
